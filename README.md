Github suggested the name 'glowing-succotash', but despite being arguably better, doesn't quite convey the essence of this repository.

This is a place where I try things out (loosely) related to the .NET ecosystem and let the world see how bad I am when trying to learn things I don't really know or kind of forgot...

If you are mad enough to be wanting to use some of this, it is available free of charge in all the BSD license glory. Just don't ask me for damage later, you've been warned.
I hope you enjoy the confusion!
